  ## Description: 
  RentIt is a website that allows users to list and rent products to each other for a set amount of days. Current rental categories are Outdoor Gear, Tools, Sports, Tech, Motorized Vehicles, Instruments, and For Kids. We plan to expand this application to allow for user messages and transactions in the near future.
